## Panologic building blocks

![Pano](./assets/pano_blocks.png) 

This is a collection of software and hardware modules for the Panologic thin 
client. The intent of this repository is that it be used as a git submodule by
other projects to avoid code [duplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).

If you don't know what a Panologic thin client then see [this](https://hackaday.com/2013/01/11/ask-hackaday-we-might-have-some-fpgas-to-hack/) 
article and refer to the links at the bottom of this page for further reading.
